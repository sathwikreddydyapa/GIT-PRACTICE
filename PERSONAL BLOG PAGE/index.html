                <p>On Ganesh Chaturthi, devotees install a beautifully decorated idol of Lord Ganesha in their homes or a public pandal. Throughout the festival, they perform daily prayers and aarti (a ritual of worship with light), offering his favorite sweets like modak. The festival concludes with the Visarjan, where the idol is immersed in a body of water, symbolizing his return to Mount Kailash.</p>
